# hello-world
My first GitHub repository
My name is Jayne and I live in San Diego, CA. I live with my family which consists of 1 husband, 1 teenage sons, 1 Pug, 3 cats, 1 rabbit, and 1 guinea pig. 
I have been software engineer for more years than I like to say. I mainly program in C++. I would like to learn web development so I am taking a Frontend development bootcamp. 
That is why I am here!
